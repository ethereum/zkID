# zkID Specifications

This directory hosts protocol specifications maintained alongside the zkID
reference implementation.

| # | Spec | Status | Summary |
| - | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `OPENAC` | _in review_ | Reserved for the OpenAC core protocol — under separate review. |
| 2 | [ZK-PROOF-OF-PERSONHOOD](./2-zk-proof-of-personhood/README.md) | raw | ZK-based one-time "verified human" status for online forums, with a deterministic nullifier. |
| 3 | [ZK-AGE-VERIFICATION](./3-zk-age-verification/README.md) | raw | Wallet-based age verification, profiled on top of OpenAC. Initial scope: Driver License for alcohol-purchase gating. |

## Change Process

Specs in this directory are governed by the process in
[`process/`](https://github.com/ethereum/access-layer-specs/tree/main/process) of
ethereum/access-layer-specs, which superseded 1/COSS.

## Editorial History

These specs were initially incubated in `privacy-ethereum/zkspecs` and moved
to this repository so they sit alongside the implementations they describe:

- `1/OPENAC` — to be added under a separate PR; previously drafted as `zkspecs#23` (and earlier `zkspecs#21`).
- `2/ZK-PROOF-OF-PERSONHOOD` — merged at `zkspecs` `specs/5` (as `5/ZK-HUMAN-VERIFICATION`); updates carried over from `zkspecs#20` and renamed to reflect the protocol concept.
- `3/ZK-AGE-VERIFICATION` — previously drafted as `zkspecs#19` (as `6/ZK-AGE-ELIGIBILITY`); renamed to reflect that the protocol verifies age, while merchant-decision-level "eligibility" wording is preserved in the spec body.
